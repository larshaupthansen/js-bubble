# JsBubble

This is little study of [progressive webapps](https://developers.google.com/web/progressive-web-apps/). It is by no means done yet.

The solution is running at http://http://js-bubble.azurewebsites.net/

This solution is made in Angular 2 and Typescript which I know is total overkill for this app, but I'm learning Angular2 so bear with me.

* Add manifest
* Add loading screen
